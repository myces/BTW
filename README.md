# BTW - Bioinformatics Through Windows


# Introduction

BTW a fully automated and easy-to-install package as well as a complete easy to follow pipeline for microbial metataxonomic analysis in the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). BTW combines several open-access tools to providing the users with a complete workflow for processing 16S rRNA data from raw sequencing reads to diversity-related conclusions. It includes data quality filtering, clustering, taxonomic assignment and further statistical analyses, directly in the WSL, avoiding the prior need of migrating from Windows to Linux. BTW is expected to boost the use of NGS amplicon data by facilitating rapid access to bioinformatics tools for Windows users. 


# Installing BTW
BTW package installation instructions can be found at http://www.brmicrobiome.org/tutorialbtw (steps 6 and 7).

*Installing the BTW package*

- Open the installed Ubuntu on Windows. 

- In the terminal, type: 
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vpylro/BTW/master/win_bmp.sh

Your UNIX account password will be requested. Type you password and then ENTER.
The BTW package will be installed automatically. This may take several minutes, depending on your computer and internet connection speeds.

- After finish installing, close the Ubuntu and open it again.
The BMP recommended pipeline for 16S rRNA data analyses is available at http://www.brmicrobiome.org/win16s
